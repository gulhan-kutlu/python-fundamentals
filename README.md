# Python Conditionals & Control Flow Examples

This repository contains Python examples developed during my university coursework.
The code demonstrates **conditional statements**, **comparison operators**, and
**control flow logic** using Python.

The purpose of this repository is to showcase fundamental Python programming concepts
and logical thinking rather than production-level applications.


## Topics Covered
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`)
- Identity vs equality (`is` vs `==`)
- Membership operators (`in`, `not in`)
- Boolean logic
- `if`, `if-else`, `elif`
- Nested conditional statements
- Ternary conditional expressions


## Notes
- These examples were created for **educational purposes**
- Focus is on **logic and syntax clarity**
- Code is console-based and interactive
